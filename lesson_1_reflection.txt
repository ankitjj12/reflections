How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It shows only the differences so identifying differences becomes better but still requires some more attention to figure out the differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: You save only what you want.
    Cons: You may miss the important changes if not saved correctly.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    We can restore at any point of time.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For my docs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
 It will allow me to check the chnages I made over time.
